## lichess.org hide the elo / player names for some fun guess the ELO

### what?
Chrome / Edge extension for hiding ELO and player names @ lichess.org FINISHED game boards

### why?
There were some extensions around, but they were pretty outdated, and I learned something.

### why is this not on extension store?
because i won't pay google money to upload my extension.

### oh my god your code is bad!
I know. I hate JS, I am not a programmer, I just steal and stitch stuff together

### next?
I don't know. if someone could upload this to google extension store thingey, would be nice. Also someone could try removing elo + player names from running games, that is currently not working (and I am just lazy)

### how?
follow this simple guide https://stackoverflow.com/a/24577660 and then simply enable the extension. In the extension menu you can click on the icon and enable it. you have to refresh the lichess page to let it take effect.
